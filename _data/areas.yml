    Behavioral equivalences are at the basis of program semantics in formal methods.
    But there's a lot of such notions.

    My research is about making the spectrum of behavioral equivalences easily usable through algorithms and tools.

    For models with internal behavior, one usually uses so-called *weak* notions of equivalence that abstract away ‚Äúinternal‚Äù aspects.

    My research interest lies with the *weakest* forms of bisimilarity, namely coupled similarity and contrasimilarity.

    Often one does not only want to model what may happen in a system but also the dependencies and causalities between events.

    I take particular interest in counterfactuals---a formal way of capturing what would need to change in order for statements to be true.

    Real-world systems and distributed algorithms rely heavily on concepts of real-time and timeouts.

    At the beginning of my studies, I was concerned with the translation of Timed CSP to Timed Automata.

    Distributed algorithms are at the core of our networked world.

    I've contributed to Isabelle/HOL formalizations of distributed consensus algorithms
    (and of the impossibility of asynchronous consensus with faulty processes).

    A lot of elegance and robustness can be achieved by expressing programs mathematically.

    I love using Scala for my programming and Isabelle/HOL for formal verifications and also teach the use of such tools.

    At the end of the day, we're all software engineers.

    I give courses touching upon Scrum project management, object-oriented programming, game dev, and quality assurance.
